# Chapter 5: Loops and Logic

## Learning Objectives
- Master for_each loops with maps
- Understand conditional resource creation
- Practice with count and for_each
- Learn complex expressions

## What This Creates
- S3 buckets for each user (for_each with map)
- IAM users for each person
- Conditional admin bucket (count with condition)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- `for_each` with maps
- `count` with conditional expressions
- `contains()` function
- For expressions in outputs
- Local values for data organization

## Try These Modifications
1. Add a new user to the locals
2. Change the condition for admin bucket
3. Add more attributes to users
4. Create resources only for specific departments
